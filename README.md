## Things to be done

1. Replace `server_url` in `api_url.js` with the server url ruby on rails app. (*Hint: when you go to that `server_url`, you should see and ugly vf case list.*)

2. ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn run build
   ```
3. You will have build folder once 2nd step completes. Upload that folder's contents to anywhere via FTP, it will be up and running.
